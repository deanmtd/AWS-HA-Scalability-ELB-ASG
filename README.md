# AWS-HA-Scalability-ELB-ASG
In this project, I implemented AWS Elastic Load Balancers to create a highly available and scalable web application infrastructure. This document showcases my understanding of AWS load balancing technologies and advanced configuration techniques, as well as the implementation of Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) for fault-tolerance and scalability.
Project Overview
In this project, I’ve implemented and configured AWS Elastic Load Balancers to create a highly available and scalable web application infrastructure. This document demonstrates my understanding of AWS load balancing technologies, implementation approaches, and advanced configuration techniques.
It also demonstrates the implementation and configuration of Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) in AWS to create a highly available, fault-tolerant, and elastically scalable web application architecture.

# Business Context
Modern web applications require high availability, fault tolerance, and the ability to scale with user demand. Load balancers are a critical component in achieving these requirements by distributing incoming traffic across multiple backend servers. This project demonstrates my ability to implement such solutions in AWS environments.
# Technologies Used
* Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
* Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
* - Application Load Balancer (ALB)
* - Network Load Balancer (NLB)
* - Gateway Load Balancer
* Security Groups
* Target Groups
* Health Checks

# Conclusion
* This project demonstrates my ability to design, implement, and configure AWS load balancing solutions that provide high availability, security, and scalability for web applications. The implementation showcases both basic functionality and advanced configurations that address real-world application requirements. By successfully completing this project, I’ve shown proficiency in AWS infrastructure, networking concepts, and security practices that are essential for modern cloud environments.
* I have demonstrated the implementation of Auto Scaling Groups in AWS to create a scalable and highly available web application architecture. By configuring launch templates, integrating with load balancers, and implementing various scaling policies, we achieved automatic adjustment of capacity based on demand.
* The target tracking policy effectively maintained CPU utilization around the target value, scaling out during high load and scaling in during periods of low utilization. This approach ensures optimal performance while minimizing costs by running only the necessary number of instances.
* Auto Scaling Groups provide a powerful solution for handling variable workloads and ensuring application availability without manual intervention.
